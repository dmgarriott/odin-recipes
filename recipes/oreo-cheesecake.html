<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Oreo Cheesecake is the ultimate dessert for Oreo</br>lovers of all ages! A rich, buttery Oreo base sits</br>beneath a luscious, ultra-creamy, Oreo-studded</br>cheesecake filling, all topped with a simple</br>homemade whipped cream.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>For the crust:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>32 (367 grams) Oreo cookies* (regular-stuffed,</br>keep filling intact), divided</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons (57 grams) butter, melted</li>
</ul>
<h4>For the filling:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>32 ounces (907 grams) cream cheese, completely</br>softened to room temperature</li>
    <li>5 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (119 grams) sour cream, at room</br>temperature</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>20 (230 grams) Oreo cookies, quartered</li>
</ul>
<h4>For the ganache:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup (170 grams) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (119 grams) heavy cream</li>
</ul>
<h4>For the whipped cream, optional:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup (237 grams) heavy cream, cold</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <h4>Make the crust:</h4>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F. In the bowl of a</br>food processor, process the cookies until they</br>are finely ground crumbs. Remove 22 grams (about</br>¼ cup) of crumbled Oreo and place in a</br>small sealed container. This will be used later</br>for topping your cheesecake.</li>
    <li>To the food processor, add the butter and pulse</br>until moistened. Press into the bottom</br>and half up the sides of a 9-inch nonstick</br>springform pan. Place the pan on a rimmed baking</br>sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Maintain</br>oven temperature.</li>
    <h4>Make the filleing:</h4>
    <li>While the crust bakes, in the bowl of an</br>electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until</br>smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, blending</br>after each addition until just combined. Scrape</br>down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add the</br>sugar, sour cream, and vanilla and beat on low</br>until combined. Be careful not to overmix. Using</br>a spatula, fold in the Oreo cookies.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter into the baked crust. This will</br>fill your pan to about 80%, but don’t</br>worry about it overflowing in the oven. With the</br>pan still on the baking sheet, bake for</br>about 1 hour, or until set and the edges and top</br>look slightly dry. If the middle is</br>slightly wobbly, that’s fine. Err on the side of</br>underbaking rather than overbaking.</li>
    <li>Turn off the oven heat and open the oven door</br>by 1 inch. I use a wooden spoon to keep it open.</br>Let the cheesecake cool inside the oven for 30</br>minutes. This helps to prevent large cracks</br>from forming.</li>
    <li>Run a thin-bladed flexible knife around the</br>edge of the cheesecake to make sure it's not</br>sticking to the sides (which can cause cracks as</br>it cools). Don’t worry if your cheesecake</br>looks lumpy, no one will know once you top with</br>ganache and whipped cream. Let the cheesecake</br>cool completely to room temperature on a wire</br>rack, about 2-3 hours. Refrigerate overnight</br>until completely chilled, or for at least 5</br>hours. Release the cheesecake from the pan onto</br>a cake stand or serving plate.</li>
    <h4>Make the ganache:</h4>
    <li>Place the chocolate chips in a medium heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, heat the cream just until simmering. Pour over the chocolate chips. Let sit for 3 minutes before stirring until the mixture is melted and smooth. Let cool slightly until thickened. Pour over the cheesecake and smooth evenly. Place cheesecake in the fridge to slightly set the ganache while you make the whipped cream.</li>
    <h4>Optional: Make the whipped cream:</h4>
    <li>Use an electric mixer to beat the cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla on high speed until stiff peaks form.</li>
    <li>Using a spatula, place half of the whipped cream on top of the cooled and slightly set ganache. Smooth to meet ganache at the edges of the cheesecake. Place the remaining half of the whipped cream in a piping bag fitted with Wilton 1M tip. Pipe swirls around the outer edge of the top of the cheesecake. Lightly sprinkle the saved Oreo crumbs on top of each piped swirl, then pour the remaining crumbs in the center of the cheesecake, gently spreading evenly.</li>
    <li>Serve or cover and store in the fridge for up to 2 days.</li>
