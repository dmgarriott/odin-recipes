<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 sticks (227 grams) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1/2 (100 grams) cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups (250 grams) lightly packed dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (190 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup (127 grams) bread flour</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (255 grams) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 cup (140 grams) semisweet chocolate baking wafers (from Guittard or Valrhona)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a small saucepan set over medium heat, melt</br>the butter. Swirling the pan occasionally,</br>continue to cook the butter. It should become</br>foamy with audible cracking and popping noises.</br>Once the crackling stops continue to swirl the</br>pan until the butter develops a nutty aroma and</br>brown bits start to form at the bottom. Once the</br>bits are amber in color, about 2 to 3</br>minutes after the popping stops, remove from</br>heat and pour into a mixing bowl. Add in the</br>sugars, stir, then set aside to cool completely.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl combine the flours, baking</br>soda, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>To the browned butter mixture, add the eggs,</br>egg yolk, and vanilla and stir with a rubber</br>spatula until combined. Slowly stir in the flour</br>mixture until just combined. Stir in the</br>chocolate chips and wafers.</li>
    <li>Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for</br>at least 24 hours but no more than 72 hours. Let</br>dough sit at room temperature just until it</br>is soft enough to scoop.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350ยบF. Line</br>baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into 3-tablespoon sized balls</br>and drop onto prepared baking sheets, leaving</br>about 3 inches between each piece of dough to</br>spread.</li>
    <li>Bake for 11 to 13 minutes, or until golden</br>brown. Let cool for 2 minutes before removing to</br>wire racks to cool completely.</li>
